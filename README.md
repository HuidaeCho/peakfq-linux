# PeakFQ for Linux

This program is a personal version of PeakFQ for Linux, which was modified from the official [USGS PeakFQ for Windows](https://water.usgs.gov/software/PeakFQ/). Their source code was missing some files and not compilable for Linux. I used the following methods to compile it on Linux:
* [How to install the Intel Fortran Compiler on Linux](https://clawiki.isnew.info/howtos/how_to_install_the_intel_fortran_compiler_on_linux)
* [How to compile PeakFQ on Linux](https://clawiki.isnew.info/howtos/how_to_compile_peakfq_on_linux)

## Disclaimer

This program is my personal work derived from the USGS PeakFQ and I am not responsible or liable for any loss or damage resulting from using it.
